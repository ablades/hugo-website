# My Professional Website!

I've been meaning to look a bit further into webdesign and what better way than to make a personal website!

## Inital Considerations/Decsions 

### Software
It took me a while to decide on a content management system to use.
I looked at  cms' that most people are familiar with like Magento, Wordpress, and Drupal. Though those seemed to be a bit overkill for what I was trying to do.
I wanted a website that would act as a live resume where the information wouldn't likely change very often. I also wanted to have a resource light system.
I eventually stumbled upon static website generators and knew they'd work fantastically.
I settled with Hugo after looking at the outstanding progress ithe community has made over the years and knew it would be great launching point.
